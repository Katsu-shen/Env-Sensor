# Env-Sensor
This sensor system continuously measures and uploads key environmental parameters. It combines a SCD30 sensor for precise COâ‚‚, humidity, and temperature readings with a BMP280 for barometric pressure. The data is displayed locally on a TFT screen and logged to an SD card, while also being published via MQTT to the cloud for remote monitoring.
